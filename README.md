QuartoPlayerAgent.java is an agent that plays the game Quarto. However, the version of Quarto that is implemented is played on a 5 by 5 board instead of 4x4, and uses 32 pieces, as opposed to 25. The new attribute is: plastic vs metal.

On branch alpha-beta-pruning:
This agent won second place in a undergrad/graduate class tournament, where each teams' agents were pitted against each others, to see whose would come out on top. It uses an expectiminimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning and a heuristic function.
